## Introduction

<p>
  Hi 👋, I'm Igor! A Data Engineering student from Brazil. I am looking for my first opportunity as a Database Administrator.

## About Me

<details>
  <summary>👨‍💻 More about me</summary>

  - 💬 I am 43 years old and live in Brazil. I am fluent in English and studying Data Engineering. I have experience with SQL, Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and basic Database Administration (DBA). I have completed courses in MySQL, Postgres, Docker, and data modeling. I am working on practical projects to gain experience as a DBA, with the goal of advancing to a Data Manager in the future. I am also studying basic data engineering and Big Data concepts, and planning to implement a small ETL project.

  - I have over 15 years of experience in customer service, which has helped me develop important skills such as creativity, communication, marketing, analytical abilities, and community and social media management.

  - ⚡ I have a strong interest in reading, especially books on philosophy, stoicism, politics, and German literature, as well as manga and comics. I also enjoy exploring articles on databases in less common languages, like Mandarin. In my free time, I love watching movies and playing video games with my son. I believe our personal interests not only enrich our worldview but also enhance our ability to solve problems creatively and effectively. \o/
