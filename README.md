## Introduction

<p>
  Hi üëã, I'm Igor! A Data Engineering student from Brazil. I am looking for my first opportunity as a Database Administrator.

## About Me

<details>
  <summary>üë®‚Äçüíª More about me</summary>

  - üí¨ I am 43 years old and live in Brazil. I am fluent in English and studying Data Engineering. I have experience with SQL, Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and basic Database Administration (DBA). I have completed courses in MySQL, Postgres, Docker, and data modeling. I am working on practical projects to gain experience as a DBA, with the goal of advancing to a Data Manager in the future. I am also studying basic data engineering and Big Data concepts, and planning to implement a small ETL project.

  - I have over 15 years of experience in customer service, which has helped me develop important skills such as creativity, communication, marketing, analytical abilities, and community and social media management.

  - ‚ö° I have a strong interest in reading, especially books on philosophy, stoicism, politics, and German literature, as well as manga and comics. I also enjoy exploring articles on databases in less common languages, like Mandarin. In my free time, I love watching movies and playing video games with my son. I believe our personal interests not only enrich our worldview but also enhance our ability to solve problems creatively and effectively. \o/

### Legacy System Migration to Azure SQL Database

**Description:**
This project aims to migrate a legacy system based on SQL Server to the Azure SQL Database cloud platform. We will use SQLDBM to model the database schema before migration, facilitating visualization and collaboration in creating the model.

**Technologies Used:**
- SQL Server
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Database Migration Service
- SQLDBM

**Skills Acquired:**
- Database migration
- Cloud database administration
- Performance optimization

**Project Structure with SQLDBM:**

1. **Planning**
   - **Modeling the Database with SQLDBM**
     - Use SQLDBM to create the model of the database to be migrated.
     - Define tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and necessary relationships.
     - Share and review the model with the team to validate the structure before implementation.
   - **Understand the Current Environment**
     - Identify the version of SQL Server.
     - Identify all databases that need to be migrated.
     - Identify application dependencies.
   - **Create an Azure Account**
     - Create an account on Azure.
     - Configure an Azure subscription.
   - **Create a Migration Plan**
     - Define the scope of migration.
     - Determine the migration method (online or offline).
     - Establish a timeline.

2. **Preparation**
   - **Database Assessment**
     - Use the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the SQL Server database.
     - Identify compatibility and performance issues.
   - **Configure Azure Environment**
     - Create an Azure SQL Database instance.
     - Configure networking and security.
   - **Backup SQL Server Database**
     - Perform a full backup of the database.
     - Store backups in a secure location.

3. **Migration**
   - **Use Azure Database Migration Service**
     - Configure Azure Database Migration Service.
     - Create a migration project.
     - Select source and destination databases.
     - Execute the initial migration.
   - **Migration Testing**
     - Verify the integrity of migrated data.
     - Test the application with Azure SQL Database.

4. **Post-Migration**
   - **Performance Optimization**
     - Monitor and optimize the performance of the database on Azure.
     - Adjust indexes and queries as necessary.
   - **Decommission the Old Environment**
     - Decommission the old SQL Server environment after confirming migration success.
   - **Documentation**
     - Document the entire migration process.
     - Create documentation for future maintenance and optimizations.

**Tools and Resources:**
- SQLDBM: Database modeling tool.
- Data Migration Assistant (DMA): Tool for compatibility and performance assessment.
- Azure Database Migration Service: Data migration service to Azure.
- Azure Portal: Graphical interface for managing Azure resources.
